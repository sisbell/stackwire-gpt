There are five example projects

* [**Batch Command**](https://github.com/sisbell/stackwire-gpt/tree/main/example/batch) - demonstrates how to create a batch process using a data file
* [**Image Generation**](https://github.com/sisbell/stackwire-gpt/tree/main/example/image) - shows how to create images with the DALL-E API
* [**Simple Experiment**](https://github.com/sisbell/stackwire-gpt/tree/main/example/experiment-simple) - shows how to run a single prompt multiple times.
* [**Chain Experiment with Single Prompt**](https://github.com/sisbell/stackwire-gpt/tree/main/example/experiment-chain-single) - shows how to run a single prompt in a chain. This technique is used for maintaining a strong context between requests
* [**Chain Experiment with Multiple Prompts**](https://github.com/sisbell/stackwire-gpt/tree/main/example/experiment-chain-multiple) - shows how to run a multiple prompts in a chain. Specifically this example shows how to use prompts to have OpenAI simulate a user response based on the context on the chain.
