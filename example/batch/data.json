    "Got this panda plush toy for my daughter's birthday, who loves it and takes it everywhere. It's soft and  super cute, and its face has a friendly look. It's  a bit small for what I paid though. I think there might be other options that are bigger for the same price. It arrived a day earlier than expected, so I got to play with it myself before I gave it to her.",
    "Needed a nice lamp for my bedroom, and this one had additional storage and not too high of a price point. Got it fast - arrived in 2 days. The string to the lamp broke during the transit and the company happily sent over a new one. Came within a few days as well. It was easy to put together. Then I had a missing part, so I contacted their support and they very quickly got me the missing piece! Seems to me to be a great company that cares about their customers and products."
